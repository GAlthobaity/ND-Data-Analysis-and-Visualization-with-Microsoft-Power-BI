## Project Overview
As a junior BI developer at SSTC, your task is to transform fragmented sales files and product records into a unified data model. This will enable the CFO to gain insights into product performance and make informed decisions. The project also involves considering currency conversion for sales in different regions and aligning with the company's fiscal calendar.

## Scenario
SSTC is a growing tea company located near Seattle, Washington (USA). The CFO recognizes the need to consolidate and analyze the sales data to gain a deeper understanding of the company's product performance. Currently, there is limited visibility on which tea beverages generate the highest profitability, apart from the flagship product, Bamboo Grove Tea.

The data collection process within the company is fragmented, making it difficult to assess the profitability of all products accurately. Additionally, SSTC operates in both Washington State (USD) and British Columbia (CAD), requiring consideration of currency conversion. Furthermore, the company follows a fiscal calendar, which needs to be taken into account while building the data model.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze the sales and profitability of different tea beverages.
- Enable the CFO to make informed decisions about product performance.
- Incorporate currency conversion for sales in different regions.
- Account for the fiscal calendar to align reporting and analysis.
